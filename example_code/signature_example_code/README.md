This is a documentation file for the code. The `path.py` is used to generate rough volatility processes in the dataset. The `example_single` folder contains the program for single parameter calibration problems and allows for the modification of signature truncation orders. The `example_multiple` folder includes the program for multiple parameters calibration and permits the adjustment of strides.

For both of `example_single` and `example_multiple` folder, our model structures are clarified by `models.py`. And all the results comes from `examples.py`, `examples_rB.py` and `examples_rH.py`.

We also provide the needed simulated data in folder `data/simulated_data`.
